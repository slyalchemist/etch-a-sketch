Welcome to the Etch-a-Sketch project!

This project's objective was to create an interactive grid
in which when you move over a square in the grid, it colors
in the square. 

It also allows the user to generate a new grid after being 
prompted for a size of the grid. 

For this project, I first focused on the function to create a simple 16x16 grid.

Once I was satisfied with the creation of the grid, I added
event listeners to allow the grid to be filled in after the
user hovers over a square. 

Once that was complete, I focused on prompting the user for a
new grid size.

Finally, the last piece of this project was creating a function
to remove the old grid so the new grid could be generated. 
This function was where I initially hit a wall but after
setting the project aside for a night, I was able to try the
function once more and successfully created a function to 
remove the old grid. 

To ensure the webpage would not be too demanding, I also placed
a restriction on the grid size when prompting the user.
